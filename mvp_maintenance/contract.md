The Service Provider will be paid Eur 200 for every start date of a month while
this agreement is active.

## Expenses

the application or any other expenses.

## Invoices

within 14 days after receipt of each invoice.

a late payment fee of 5% will be added to the amount. It will be readded every
16 days if the full amount is not covered.
